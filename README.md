*The bare minimum configuration from defaults for my Linux setup*

This repository used to contain an insane amount of config files and settings for my highly-riced terminal/keyboard-centric Arch Linux desktop, but I've since moved on to trying to change as little as possible to get a nice, working setup. I currently primarily use Fedora, and try to use default programs and settings when possible.
